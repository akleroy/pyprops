Python CPROPS implementation.

Functionality is grouped into families of utilities (though these are
interlinked, not totally independent). Current functionality:

NOISE ESTIMATION - in 1, 2, or 3d "noiseutils"

MASKING - with joint SNR thresholding across channels and small region
rejection.

BLOB COLORING - region extraction and characterization at a pixel
level.

LOCAL MAX IDENTIFICATION - identification of peaks.

The next few things:

CUBE HANDLING - utilities to deal with cube input/output

ASSIGNMENT - utilities to deal with colored cubes

MERGER/TREE HANDLING -

PROPERTY CALCULATION -
