Python "CPROPStoo" Implementation
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Implementation of the signal-identification, object extraction, and
emission characterization package "cprops" in python.

--------------------
OVERALL STRUCTURE
--------------------

cube - a generic CASA/FITS interface to pull in a data cube

data - read and manipulate data cubes. Inherits cube.

mask - create, manipulate, and read/write masks. Inherits cube.

noise - defines a class to derive noise estimates

assign - a "colored" cube that assigns pixels to objects

lmax - identifies local maxima

struct - helper class to build morphological structuring elements

--------------------
NEXT STEPS
--------------------

- Beam handling in "cube"

- Unit handling in "data" (Jy <-> K main hurdle, leverage astropy)

- Automatic masking parameters from negative (accept a thresholding
  definition and suggest a value that yields no negatives).

- Assignment object

- "Moment" object

- Up noise dimensionality

- Noise read/write

- Revisit "struct" and make it cleaner/clearer

- "Suggested subcubes" in mask

- Primary beam correction into "cube" (and noise?)

- Rework noise so that it inherits cube? Noise needs to decide if it
  is something that lives on its own or is always recomputed on the
  fly. I like the former.

- a general validate() function that runs a suite of sanity checks and
  reports back. Cleaning up some of this stuff is out of scope but we
  can at least shout on units, untyped axes, axis order, etc.

--------------------
OTHER DIRECTIONS
--------------------

- all kinds of error checking

- moment creation / linkage to CASA / error propagation

- radial profile construction

- two-d header / spectrum header extraction - useful for writing a
  minimum sized noise object.

- spectral stacking implementation

COMMENTS
--------------------

- Basically, every cube operation for something the size of the
  Antennae Cycle 0 on a reasonable desktop takes about 1-2s for a
  single numpy cube operation. A typical "astronomical" operation
  involves say 3-10 of these and sometimes ~100. That sets your
  timescales for anything.

- We may want a "blank value" for the cube object (in addition to the
  validity flag). Masked arrays are still a mixed bag and adding a
  blanking step to the beginning of each task makes things
  slow. Similarly, pre-computing the min and max would probably be
  useful. My rough checks are that doing this prep within each program
  takes something like 5-6 seconds, which adds up. Alternatively, we
  may want a high level routine in cube or data object to expose a
  numpy-friendly object with a blank value filled in. Issue is that
  what we want is not obvious (its 0 for summing, it's a very low or
  high value for masking).

- The merge calculation is slow. Not prohibitively, but N labelings of
  a big cube are heading in that direction. The issue is at least
  partially that the whole cube is thrown in and repeatedly processed
  in operations where only a tiny fraction of the data are
  interesting. Right now it's ~2 seconds per label operation on the
  Antennae, so ~3 minutes to get the matrix for 100
  levels. Astrodendro (see below) offers one path: loop over the
  individual sorted pixels.

- Easy link to astrodendro: cube + mask + valid to set invalid values
  to floor, then pass the manipulated cube in. It's fast when heavily
  downselected first, which makes sense. Twiddle a minute on the
  Antennae with 3-sigma clipping (~1% of the data). However, it's slow
  (worse than merging) when fed the whole cube, so a clip first is
  going to be needed.
